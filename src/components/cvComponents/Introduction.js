        technical and transferable skills, gained through my extensive

        With over 20 years of running a successful plastering business I have
        honed my problem-solving, leadership, and client management abilities,
        all of which I am eager to apply to the tech field. Recently, I have
        completed relevant entry-level qualifications in web development and
        programming, including JavaScript and Python.
